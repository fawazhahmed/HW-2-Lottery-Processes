# HW 2 Lottery Processes
This code will choose a process at random. There is a process and a scheduler class which takes care of this. The process class will get you the number of tickets and the processor number to be used by the scheduler class. The scheduler class will choose tickets through a randomizer algorithm along with taking care of adding any additional processes, choosing a winner, and displaying key information along the way.
It will tell you the processes are executing, which processor won the lottery, the scheduler state where it displays total tickets, and updated ticket numbers utilizing the random function.
To run the program, go to lines 76-78 and change the second number (currently 10 for processor 1, 20 for processor 2, and 30 for processor 3).
This will edit the amount of tickets resulting in a higher or lower chance of winning based on the number you enter. The higher the number, the better the chance of it winning. Feel free to add processes as this is implemented using a vector pushback function.
